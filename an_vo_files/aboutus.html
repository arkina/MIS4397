<!-- Glyphish asks people to provide a link to show thanks for using their icons in our programs. 
While I'm sure it's not completely necessary to do so, I went ahead and added a link to them here just in case.  
At the very least, it would be there for me to see that my code for linking to website works although I have
no problem removing this line in the future to make our app more presentable.  Heh. -->

<!-- To be honest, I'm not really sure if we need a aboutus page.  Unless we have alot to say about ourselves, 
I think I can just put this small bit of info on the home page.  As of now it's just here just to be here
but I might consider removing this page for something else in the future. -->
